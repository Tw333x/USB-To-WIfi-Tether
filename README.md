# USB-To-WIfi-Tether
Tool I created to create a hotspot using cell phone via usb. 

I created this tool because I have a AT&T S5 where no root is availble and stock wifi tether would not work on the carrier(cricket) I am on.
This tool will create a hotspot using your phone via usb. I use PdaNet for usb tethering then use this tool to create a hotspot for all my devices.

Older version but should still be the same steps.

Enjoy!
